# Mini Projects

- [face-recognition/](mini-projects/face-recognition/) : Recognizes the person in a photo (*or an individual frame from a video stream*). A convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained on a few hundred photos of the persons (*"subjects"*) to recognize.
- `identify-aircraft` : Image classifier (a convolutional neural network, aka CNN) to identify aircraft models based on photos without relying on any additional information (i.e., no EXIF data, no tags, etc.).
- `which-gender` : A comparison of a few text classification approaches (*Bag of Words*, Word2Vec, Doc2Vec) for identifying the gender of blog authors based on his/her writing style.

### Ancient (2014 and earlier)

- `ebola-outbreak-viz` : Visualization (using R) of districts affected by the 2014 Ebola outbreak
- `simulator/clickstream-generator` : Simulates user clickstream based on a specified page navigation graph.
- `poc/etailer/recommender-system` : Simple item-based recommender
